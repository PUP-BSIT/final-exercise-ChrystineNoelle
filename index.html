				<h2>My Journal</h2>
				<p>Reflecting on my journey over the past few months, the challenges and pressures have been intense. There were moments of doubt, but as I look ahead, I find a renewed sense of purpose. The hardships are undoubtedly worth it, especially when I think about the future I am working towards.</p>
				<p> I've updated my goals, and they now serve as a roadmap for the next five years. The prospect of supporting my family, mastering design, creating memories through travel, and achieving success in the industry fuels my determination. Each goal is a stepping stone, and I am committed to the journey, embracing the growth and learning it brings.</p>
				<p>As I embark on this personal and professional adventure, I want to keep this journal as a testament to my sincerity and dedication. It's a reminder that even during challenging times, I stayed true to my aspirations and worked towards a future that aligns with my values and dreams.</p>
